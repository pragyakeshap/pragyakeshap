# Hi, I’m Pragya Keshap 👋

**Technical Lead** building secure, scalable, cloud-native systems in **e-commerce, fintech, and enterprise**.  
I design AI-driven platforms with a strong focus on **cloud security, API management, and containerized deployments** on **Google Cloud**, **Kubernetes**, and **Docker**.  
I love turning complex problems into clear, reliable, and human-centered solutions.

- 🔭 **Current focus:** AI-enabled DevSecOps, API threat analytics, confidential computing (SGX / SEV-SNP), and governance for trustworthy AI  
- 🧭 **What I do:** Architecture reviews, hands-on prototypes, migration playbooks 
- ✍️ **Write:** Cloud security, Observability, AI governance, API gateways — articles, book chapters, and conference papers  
- 🤝 **Collaborate on:** Docker extensions, GKE patterns, Application modernization, cloud migration, cloud security, dashboards, and policy-as-code labs
